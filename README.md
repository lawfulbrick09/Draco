Firstly the stock, most stocks already made were made very poorly with very low quality models or textures. This model was primary based off the Century Arms Micro Draco 7.62Ã—39 linked bellow this was done for 2 primary reasons, the stock was unique and imidiatly identifiable and also it was romanian so it was very easy to track down the type of woord used.

The wood used was assumend to be the Beech tree due to its distictive hue and color.
